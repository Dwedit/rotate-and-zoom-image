# Rotate and Zoom Image

[![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/v/rotate-and-zoom-image.svg)](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/rotate-and-zoom-image/)

Rotate and Zoom Image is a basic replacement for [Image Zoom](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/image-zoom/) or [Rotate Image](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/rotate-image/), and already compatible with future versions of Firefox. It allows to rotate and zoom images directly on any website from the image context menu. Just right-click the image and see options at the bottom of the context menu. At this moment it may lack some features, like custom zoom ratios or rotation angles, but it aims to stay lightweight and predictable.
