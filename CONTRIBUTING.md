# How to get involved

## Localization

The easiest way to get involved is to help translating the add-on to your language. If your language is already provided, but incomplete or inaccurate, feel free to update it, either (directly via GitHub)[https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/] or by forking and making a pull request. All the necessary files are placed in the [`src/_locales` directory](https://github.com/MikkCZ/rotate-and-zoom-image/tree/master/src/_locales).

If you want to add a new language, the best way to do it is to first [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). In your local clone, copy the [`src/_locales/en` directory](https://github.com/MikkCZ/rotate-and-zoom-image/tree/master/src/_locales/en) and give the copy an appropriate name based on you language ISO code. Now you can edit the `messages.json` file in your favorite editor and once you are ready, commit and push your changes and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) from your fork.

## Coding

If you know, how to do WebExtensions, or want to learn and try, you are welcome to pick anything from the [list](https://github.com/MikkCZ/rotate-and-zoom-image/issues) and start working on it, just write a note you started, to prevent two people doing the same work at the same time. If you have never tried to make a browser add-on, [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions) and [Chrome documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) will always help you.
