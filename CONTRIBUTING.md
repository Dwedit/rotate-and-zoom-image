# How to get involved

## Report bugs

The easiest way to get involved is to use the add-on and any issues you find [report here](https://github.com/MikkCZ/rotate-and-zoom-image/issues).

## Localization

A more active, but also very easy way is to help translating the add-on to your language. If your language is already provided, but incomplete or inaccurate, feel free to update it using [this online tool](https://poeditor.com/join/project/OCrDGbtroC). If you want to add a new language, please request it via the online tool or simply file an issue in this repository.

## Coding

If you know, how to do WebExtensions, or want to learn and try, you are welcome to pick anything from the [list](https://github.com/MikkCZ/rotate-and-zoom-image/issues) and start working on it, just write a note you started, to prevent two people doing the same work at the same time. If you have never tried to make a browser add-on, [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions) and [Chrome documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) will always help you.
